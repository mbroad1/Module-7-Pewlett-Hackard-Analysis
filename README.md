- When analyzing the employees ready to retire by title, I found that the majority of titles of these employees were of seniority ranking such as **Senior Engineer**, **Senior Staff**, and **Technique Leader**.
    - Therefore, many senior-ranked employees will be retiring soon and in a similar time frame.

### The Unique Titles Table Corroborates the First Point

- Likewise, when looking at the unique titles table, we can see that employees ready to retire have senior-ranked positions like **Senior Engineer**, **Senior Staff**, and **Technique Leader** as well as positions like **Staff**, **Engineer**, and **Assistant Engineer**.
    - This observation corroborates the findings found in the retirement title table, and also shows that in general, the company would be losing a significant amount of other employees besides senior-ranked employees like Engineers and Staff. 

### The Number of Senior-Ranked Employees Ready to Retire is Significantly High
![]()
- The retiring titles table reveals that the total number of Senior Engineers that are ready to retire is **29,414** and the total number of Senior Staff ready to retire is **28,254**.
- Likewise, the number of Engineers that are ready to retire is **14,222**, the number of Staff ready to retire is **12,243**, the number of Technique Leaders ready to retire is **4,502**, the number of Assistant Engineers ready to retire is **1,761**, and finally, the number of Managers ready to retire is **2**.
- Overall, there is a very high number of senior-ranked employees and a significant number of other types of employees prone to retire soon.

### The Need to Incentivize Joining the Mentorship Eligibility Program
![]()
- Due to the high number of senior-ranked employees and employees in general that are ready to retire in the near future, it is pertinent that these employees are incentivized to stay with the company and train younger employees by joining the mentorship eligibility program.
   - This program will let employees that are ready to retire taper off from the work-load of their roles so that they can spend more time training younger employees so that these employees can transition into these senior-ranked roles as many will be vacated soon.
